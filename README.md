# Computer-Applications-Project
*My high school programming project, (nearly) untouched*

**Everything is in Portuguese.**

**As far as I can possibly tell, this will only run on Windows.**

This project was done in pairs. Therefore, permission was granted by my classmate to upload the source code of the project, whose name I shall maintain private.

**The project is divided in two parts:**
- An "algorithm" provided by the teachers which is based in counting numbers;
- An event manager program that can also access the Discord webhook API to push notifications into it.
- And a menu to tie both programs together.

Given the weird nature of the project itself (two unrelated programs bound by a single menu form), I will upload a fork of this with the main feature only.

Compiled binaries for 32 and 64 bit (i386/amd64) are available on the `bin` folder.

Given that this is for record keeping purposes, the source code shouldn't change.
